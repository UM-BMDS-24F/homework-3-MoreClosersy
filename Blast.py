# 1. I used BLASTp for the comparison since itâ€™s designed for aligning protein sequences,
# making it suitable for analyzing similarities between mouse and human proteins.

# 2. BLOSUM62 was chosen as it is the default matrix for BLASTp and is particularly effective
# for proteins with moderate divergence, which is typical in comparisons between two mammalian species.

# 3. An E-value of 0.00001 ensures a high threshold, filtering out random matches while still capturing significant alignments.
# By setting the number of alignments to 1, we focus on the most homologous sequence, minimizing processing needs.
# Additionally, using the XML format (outfmt 5) simplifies parsing for IDs and alignment details.
